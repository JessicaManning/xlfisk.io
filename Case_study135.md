# Case Study: Opus 135

## Jacobs School of Music, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN

### A Fresh Start

2006 marked the beginning of the extraordinary opportunity to build a new recital organ in Auer Hall for the students and faculty of the Jacobs School of Music. For the University, the commission signified a fresh start– some years earlier a different builder had been contracted but that project was plagued with problems and delays and was ultimately abandoned. We set about planning and design for a new instrument with the understanding that we would incorporate as much of the existing case as possible.

It is often said that an organ is only as good as the room it is in. In considering the new instrument’s placement an acoustical evaluation was conducted  by Kirkegaard Acoustic Design as well as informal listening tests. The results suggested placing the new organ against the back wall of the building and adding low frequency support to the coffered ceiling.  The reconsidered position also allowed for access to the console from outside the organ, space to conduct master classes and collaborate with other instrumentalists close at hand.

### Tonal Design

The goal for the major organ at a music school is that it be able to convincingly play many centuries-worth of music of many different compositional styles.  Though Opus 135 does indeed “lean toward the French”, that is the 19th-century work of Aristide Cavaille-Cöll, its pipework is varied enough to cover organ literature from Sweelinck to Couperin to Bach to Messaien to Lauridsen with great authenticity.
