	<p>How to get started - Things to consider in the early stages.</p>

	<details>
		<summary>
			<b id="request-for-information">Request for Information</b>
		</summary>

		<p>Your pipe organ project will likely begin with a question: Have we built successful instruments in venues similar to yours? When could a new organ be delivered? What might the costs be? How would we work together?</p>

                <p>Naturally cost is a primary concern. At this time a rough estimate may be possible but before actual budgets or fund raising goals are set a more complete assessment of your requirements and circumstances will be necessary.</p>

                <p>Perhaps you don’t feel you have sufficient understanding of the instrument to navigate these important decisions. Your church or organization may wish to engage a consultant to help assess your needs and goals and identify the firms most able to realize them. We are ready to work with you directly or through your consultant.</p>

                <p>If you are considering builders for a new organ or just wondering where to begin, we are always happy to talk. When you call the Fisk workshop you will be speaking with the very people who build the instruments. It is our pleasure to help make your vision a reality. We hope you will give us the opportunity to do our best work for you.</p>

                     <p> There is no better way to refine your vision for a new Fisk than to see, hear or play one. You will find Fisk pipe organs in many locations across the U.S. and several overseas. We would be happy to put you in touch with clients whose instruments are similar to what you are envisioning and help arrange a visit. Our clients are in the best position to offer an unbiased view of what it is like to work with us, how their project unfolded, and the results of our efforts.</p>

                     <p> If you are able, we invite you to visit our workshop in Gloucester, MA, meet our team and see what we are working on. There are several landmark Fisk organs in the area that we would be pleased to show you.</p>

			<b id="request-for-proposal">Request for Proposal</b>
		</summary>

		<p>After initial discussions, you may decide to ask for a formal proposal from us. We ask you for information in order to tailor a proposal to your specific wishes and needs. We'll want to know the size and uses of your facility; for instance, how many people does it seat? What are the approximate dimensions of the room, especially the ceiling height, and its cubic footage? Architectural drawings are often very helpful for existing buildings, or sketches for those buildings just being planned. Photographs of your building, inside and out, will help give us the flavor of the architecture and a sense of the space. In addition, if any acoustical studies have been done on your building, they tell us much about how our instrument will sound in the room.</p>

		<p>Many clients request a consultation visit from us, which we highly recommend. One of the principal members of our firm will come to your church, school or concert hall and spend a day or two getting to know you and the site. We'll have more questions. What kinds of repertoire are most often played? Will the organ be used with orchestras, soloists, or choirs, or all of the above? If in a church, what are the liturgical requirements of the organ? What stops do you want to see included?</p>

		<p>During a consultation visit we have the opportunity to meet your committees, prospective donors, architects, and others concerned, to explain the process and answer questions. We ask that our travel and room and board costs for such a visit be covered, but there are no charges for the consultation itself.</p>

		<p>We are always pleased to put you in touch with clients for whom we have already built organs. There is no one better to tell you what it is like to work with us, how the project unfolded, and the results of our efforts. These former customers can be very helpful in refining your vision.</p>

			<p>Our relations with the personnel at Fisk were outstanding. The principals of the firm communicated effectively with us at every stage of the project, and the various craftspeople and voicers who spent a number of months on our campus endeared themselves to our community.

	    <summary><b id="proposal-and-contract">Proposal and Contract</b></summary>

	    <p>Our discussions progress as we ask and answer important questions of each other.   We&#39;ll want to know the size and uses of your facility. How many people does it seat, its rough dimensions, are architectural drawings available, what kinds of repertoire are most often played, and much more. It is often advisable to schedule a site visit where we can see your venue and discuss the possibilities in greater detail.
	    When we have come to a thorough understanding of your requirements and wishes we can present a formal proposal. This will include a stop list and the rational    behind it, a design concept sketch, a sample contract, costs and other terms and    conditions. The proposal is our best suggestion for your particular needs.
	    While it is detailed, our proposal is not the final word. It may well stimulate deeper discussion, illuminate challenges and clarify what work remains to be done. Every organ specification is a balance of wishes and means and therefore every Fisk is unique. We expect and welcome further conversation.
	    When we come to complete consensus, a clear and concise contract can be signed with confidence.

		</summary>

		<p>We seek to create instruments of great beauty that are at home in their surroundings and seem to have always having been there. The design process is complex. Achieving a balance of mechanical, acoustical, and aesthetic factors requires expertise, imagination and your thoughtful observations.</p>

		<p>Our first step is a site visit. Photographs and extensive measurements are made of your venue, or for buildings under construction, architectural drawings are procured. Back at our workshop this information is used to construct a detailed, 3-dimensional scale model of your venue. Within the model the design of the organ begins with the Stop List providing the basis from which the layout of the organ is developed.</p>

    <p>We have found model making to be an invaluable asset to the design process. The model reveals shape, volume, sight lines and even light in a natural and fluid manner. It also offers an unparalleled ability to share the design process with you, via photographs, teleconference or directly during your visits.</p>

			<p>… that’s the point of music in worship; to transport us from our physical lives, to give us a glimpse at the eternal. Music is the medium that gives breath to the mystical. Not everyone will understand the minutia of a fine pipe organ, but people do recognize beauty. Beauty and music are inherent attributes of the celebration of divinity and Fisk has brought such beauty to our parish.</p>

	<p>The full shop turns its attention to the project - Client visits welcome. A celebration when the organ is ready to leave the shop - customer participation welcomed and encouraged.</p>

	<details>
		<summary>
			<b id="shop-construction">Shop Construction</b>
		</summary>

		<p>When the final design for an organ nears completion the full shop turns its attention to the project. Shop drawings are prepared either by hand or with AutoCAD detailing every part. Metal is alloyed and cast in sheets from which pipes are made. Seasoned lumber is purchased in the rough, then planed and sawn to create the casework and myriad interior parts of the organ. Keyboards of bone or exotic woods are constructed. Pipework is shop-voiced to preliminary levels and prepared for final installation. Pieces and sub-assemblies are brought together in our 30' by 60' set-up room and the organ is fully assembled and tested. Client visits are welcomed throughout the process, but are especially encouraged at the end when we host an Open Shop.</p>

	<details>
		<summary>
			<b id="open-shop">Open Shop</b>
		</summary>

		<p>We have an open house to celebrate the end of the construction phase of a project, and to give us a chance to show our work to family, friends, suppliers, and colleagues before it leaves Gloucester. Hundreds of people attend these Saturday afternoon gatherings at which our clients and their friends are the guests of honor. Visitors are encouraged to play the organ, tour the shop, and take part in the celebration. It is a great way to invest donors and friends of the project with a sense of the magnitude of their gifts. After the Open Shop the organ is dismantled and carefully packed in air-ride moving vans for transport and delivery, normally three or four weeks later.</p>

	<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

	<p>We make a community-building event of the unloading of the trucks. The organ is assembled on site - Organbuilders as artisans-in residence - Each pipe is painstakingly adjusted to the acoustics of the individual room. </p>

	<details>
		<summary>
			<b id="delivery">Delivery</b>
		</summary>

		<p>The day the organ arrives is also a great opportunity for community building and creating a sense of ownership of the new instrument. At churches, the truck pulls up just after the last service on Sunday, and parishioners are asked to help with the unloading. There are many jobs to be done, even for those of no great strength. Many people have told us that delivery day is an event that brings whole congregations together, and becomes an historic milestone in the life of the church, one that today's children will tell their grandchildren about, "I helped when the organ was delivered, sixty years ago."</p>

	</details>

	<details>
		<summary>
			<b id="installation-and-voicing">Installation and Voicing</b>
		</summary>

		<p>A crew of installation specialists arrives with the organ, typically four or five of the organbuilders who built the organ in the shop. We direct the unloading, then begin the process of re-assembling the organ and fitting it to the building, normally a month of work for a moderate instrument. We think of ourselves as artisans-in-residence and we see education as part of our work, scheduling question and answer sessions to give those interested in the work a chance to learn more about it.</p>

		<p>Once the organ is fully assembled, voicers arrive to begin the work of adjusting each pipe to the acoustics of the building, a task that can only be done on site. It is precise and demanding work, carried on by teams of two people in three or four week rotations. Voicing a moderately sized organ can be the work of four or five months.</p>

		<p>No organbuilding company spends as much time on installation and voicing as does C. B. Fisk. Twenty percent of all the hours in a project happen on your site. This care and artistic precision is a part of what differentiates our company from all others.</p>

		<p><a href="#our-process">Back to top</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The installation of the instrument - involving careful and precise work - was impressive to observe. Fisk teams worked industriously for months to get the sound that they wanted to hear from the pipes in the new Bridges Hall organ. As a College Organist, I made daily visits to the site - the Fisk personnel were very well prepared to explain the work they carried out in the voicing process not only to me but to people of widely different backgrounds who visited the Hall during these months.</p>

			<b id="dedication">Dedication</b>
		</summary>

		<p>When the organ is completed most clients have a concert or series of concerts to celebrate the conclusion of the project and to present the instrument to the wider public. These events often include master classes by visiting recitalists, gala concerts and consecratory services at religious institutions. We have wide experience to offer you in helping to organize these special occasions.</p>

			<p>I want to express my deep appreciation to you and to everyone at C. B. Fisk for your work on Opus 98. The superb instrument which you built for us is something of great value for First Presbyterian Church and the Evansville community. I have heard nothing but positive comments about the organ from the people of the church and the many visitors who have already come to see and hear it. From my standpoint as a musician, the organ is a joy to work with. It has already taught me a great deal. Of course the building of a new organ was the stated purpose of the business association between C. B. Fisk, Inc. and First Presbyterian Church. However, from the time you and Charlie came to Evansville back in 1980, I felt there was something more to the project than just business. Teaching and learning about the ancient but exciting and multi-faceted art was central. And of course there was the determination to do the job as well as it could possibly be done. How appropriate that this art and such attitudes should be nourished and supported by the church!</p>
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>
			<p>There is something that I will treasure as much as the opportunity of working with the new organ: the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the people who built this marvelous instrument with so much care and love for what they are doing. The thoughtful, courteous, generous, and caring attitudes which the people at C. B. Fisk have shown in their relationship with the people of First Presbyterian Church are also things of great value. In this respect, to say nothing of the extraordinary instrument you have built for us, we are beneficiaries of something which is truly priceless.</p>
