	<p>How to get started - Things to consider in the early stages.</p>

	<details>
		<summary>
			<b id="request-for-information">Request for Information</b>
		</summary>

		<p>Most projects begin with a request for information from an organist or music director, church organ committee, a prospective donor, an architect or designer at a concert hall, or a college or university organist. You may wish to know what we have done in the past that may be similar to the situation in which you find yourself. We have attempted to provide a partial answer to that question in our Instruments section, where we have divided our list of completed work by opus number, by location, by venue, and by size. As designers and builders of custom instruments we hope you will see the breadth of our experience, and that we treat each project individually. Even if you do not see a completed organ similar to your vision, we can help.</p>

		<p>Some clients do not feel they have sufficient knowledge of the organ to make the choices necessary in acquiring a new instrument and decide to hire a consultant. Consultants can often help people assess their needs and wishes and then discover organbuilders who can realize their goals. We are ready to work with you directly, or through your consultant. The American Guild of Organists offers several books that clarify the issues that may arise in purchasing a pipe organ. You can find them on the AGO web site. How soon can an organ be delivered? We build instruments in the order in which the contracts are signed, unless customers experience delays in the readiness of their buildings.</p>

		<p>Our experience and our production data enable us to give you a realistic and accurate estimate of when an organ of a given size may be delivered, how long installation will take, and how long voicing will require. In an industry plagued by late delivery we have been on time or ahead of schedule for the last fifteen years. One of the most frequently asked questions concerns approximate costs. We price instruments in their entirety, not per stop, or set, of pipes. Not all sets of pipes are equal in price. At the early stages it is sometimes possible to give a rough estimate based on the size of the room and the uses to which an organ will be put, but for actual budgeting or fund raising purposes it is best to wait until we have been able to more fully assess your needs and make a full proposal.</p>

		<p>If you are thinking about a new organ, we are always happy to talk. We do not have any high-pressure sales staff. When you call C. B. Fisk you will be talking to the very people who build the instruments themselves. It is our pleasure to help make your vision a reality. We hope you will give us the opportunity to do our best work for you.</p>

			<b id="request-for-proposal">Request for Proposal</b>
		</summary>

		<p>After initial discussions, you may decide to ask for a formal proposal from us. We ask you for information in order to tailor a proposal to your specific wishes and needs. We'll want to know the size and uses of your facility; for instance, how many people does it seat? What are the approximate dimensions of the room, especially the ceiling height, and its cubic footage? Architectural drawings are often very helpful for existing buildings, or sketches for those buildings just being planned. Photographs of your building, inside and out, will help give us the flavor of the architecture and a sense of the space. In addition, if any acoustical studies have been done on your building, they tell us much about how our instrument will sound in the room. Many clients request a consultation visit from us, which we highly recommend. One of the principal members of our firm will come to your church, school or concert hall and spend a day or two getting to know you and the site. We'll have more questions. What kinds of repertoire are most often played? Will the organ be used with orchestras, soloists, or choirs, or all of the above? If in a church, what are the liturgical requirements of the organ? What stops do you want to see included? During a consultation visit we have the opportunity to meet your committees, prospective donors, architects, and others concerned, to explain the process and answer questions. We ask that our travel and room and board costs for such a visit be covered, but there are no charges for the consultation itself. We are always pleased to put you in touch with clients for whom we have already built organs. There is no one better to tell you what it is like to work with us, how the project unfolded, and the results of our efforts. These former customers can be very helpful in refining your vision.</p>

			<p>Our relations with the personnel at Fisk were outstanding. The principals of the firm communicated effectively with us at every stage of the project, and the various craftspeople and voicers who spent a number of months on our campus endeared themselves to our community. The organ was completed ahead of the scheduled contract date.</p>

			<b id="proposal-and-contract">Proposal and Contract</b>
		</summary>

		<p>When you are ready, we make a more formal proposal. Proposals include an organ specification, or stop list, a sample agreement, and a proposed design sketch, as well as other information about the company you may require. Each specification has a price associated with it, and a suggested schedule of payments, as well as a description of how the various stops will answer your specific needs. Each of these proposal sections is our best suggestion for your specific needs, but is not by any means our final word on what should be done. In fact, the proposal, sometimes the first concrete step toward the realization of a dream, often stimulates deeper discussion, illuminates challenges not heretofore recognized, and clarifies what work is still to be done. Almost every specification is a balance of wishes and means. We expect and welcome further conversation. The sample agreement will be from a template we have used many times to codify the responsibilities of C. B. Fisk and the customer. The dates of delivery will be based upon our extensive experience in rational scheduling and in keeping our promises. Costs will likewise be clearly stated, and we will be ready to clarify those items included in the agreement and those that are not. When we come to complete consensus a contract can be signed.</p>

			<p>In sum, from a business standpoint, Fisk delivered exactly what they promised, when they promised it, and for the agreed price, without a hitch. From a design and musical standpoint, they created an instrument of extraordinary beauty, flexibility, and power.</p>

	<p>A model is made of client's venue - Customer participation by visits or photos - Visual design and mechanical design of the organ - Preparation of the building to receive the organ.</p>

	<details>
		<summary>
			<b id="tonal-and-visual-design">Tonal and Visual design</b>
		</summary>

		<p>When design work begins on your project, the first step is a site visit from a senior designer, often the shop member who will act as the Project Manager. Extensive photographs and measurements are taken of your existing building, or studies made of the drawings for buildings under construction. Upon returning to the shop, a highly detailed 1:16 scale model is constructed of the portion of the building where the organ will go. We have used this method of design since the founding of the company in 1961, and continue to use it even in conjunction with the computer-aided drafting we have employed since 1986. This dual method gives us the opportunity to experience your room as if we were actually in it, to pick up nuances of the shape and details of the space, and to relate motifs in the organ design to the architectural motifs of the room. We seek to create instruments of great beauty that are at home in their surroundings and have the quality of always having been there. The model also gives us an unparalleled ability to share the design process with you as it moves forward, whether through your visits to the shop or digital photography sent via email. At the same time as visual design begins the internal mechanical and structural design commence as well. Any preparation of the building to accept the new organ is discussed at this time. Topics to explore often include the acoustical environment, electrical service, HVAC systems, and weight bearing capabilities.</p>

			<p>Fisk's design team worked with our acoustician, architects and church liaisons to prepare the space for our instrument, putting in time on our project long before it was even at the preliminary design phase. [Tonal Director] David Pike's expertise and artistry in tonal matters is astounding. He is an organist, with a degree from Eastman, and knows the literature; so he hears every stop's potential while it is still an idea on paper.</p>

	<p>The full shop turns its attention to the project - Client visits welcome. A celebration when the organ is ready to leave the shop - customer participation welcomed and encouraged.</p>

	<details>
		<summary>
			<b id="shop-construction">Shop Construction</b>
		</summary>

		<p>When the final design for an organ nears completion the full shop turns its attention to the project. Shop drawings are prepared either by hand or with AutoCAD detailing every part. Metal is alloyed and cast in sheets from which pipes are made. Seasoned lumber is purchased in the rough, then planed and sawn to create the casework and myriad interior parts of the organ. Keyboards of bone or exotic woods are constructed. Pipework is shop-voiced to preliminary levels and prepared for final installation. Pieces and sub-assemblies are brought together in our 30' by 60' set-up room and the organ is fully assembled and tested. Client visits are welcomed throughout the process, but are especially encouraged at the end when we host an Open Shop.</p>

			<b id="open-shop">Open Shop</b>
		</summary>

		<p>We have an open house to celebrate the end of the construction phase of a project, and to give us a chance to show our work to family, friends, suppliers, and colleagues before it leaves Gloucester. Hundreds of people attend these Saturday afternoon gatherings at which our clients and their friends are the guests of honor. Visitors are encouraged to play the organ, tour the shop, and take part in the celebration. It is a great way to invest donors and friends of the project with a sense of the magnitude of their gifts. After the Open Shop the organ is dismantled and carefully packed in air-ride moving vans for transport and delivery, normally three or four weeks later.</p>

	<p>We make a community-building event of the unloading of the trucks.</p>

	<details>
		<summary>
			<b id="delivery">Delivery</b>
		</summary>

		<p>The day the organ arrives is also a great opportunity for community building and creating a sense of ownership of the new instrument. At churches, the truck pulls up just after the last service on Sunday, and parishioners are asked to help with the unloading. There are many jobs to be done, even for those of no great strength. Many people have told us that delivery day is an event that brings whole congregations together, and becomes an historic milestone in the life of the church, one that today's children will tell their grandchildren about, "I helped when the organ was delivered, sixty years ago."</p>

			<b id="installation-and-voicing">Installation and Voicing</b>
		</summary>

		<p>The organ is assembled on site - Organbuilders as artisans-in residence - Each pipe is painstakingly adjusted to the acoustics of the individual room. A crew of installation specialists arrives with the organ, typically four or five of the organbuilders who built the organ in the shop. We direct the unloading, then begin the process of re-assembling the organ and fitting it to the building, normally a month of work for a moderate instrument. We think of ourselves as artisans-in-residence and we see education as part of our work, scheduling question and answer sessions to give those interested in the work a chance to learn more about it. Once the organ is fully assembled, voicers arrive to begin the work of adjusting each pipe to the acoustics of the building, a task that can only be done on site. It is precise and demanding work, carried on by teams of two people in three or four week rotations. Voicing a moderately sized organ can be the work of four or five months. No organbuilding company spends as much time on installation and voicing as does C. B. Fisk. Twenty percent of all the hours in a project happen on your site. This care and artistic precision is a part of what differentiates our company from all others.</p>

		<p><a href="#our-process">Back to top</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The installation of the instrument - involving careful and precise work - was impressive to observe. Fisk teams worked industriously for months to get the sound that they wanted to hear from the pipes in the new Bridges Hall organ. As a College Organist, I made daily visits to the site - the Fisk personnel were very well prepared to explain the work they carried out in the voicing process not only to me but to people of widely different backgrounds who visited the Hall during these months.</p>

			<b id="dedication">Dedication</b>
		</summary>

		<p>When the organ is completed most clients have a concert or series of concerts to celebrate the conclusion of the project and to present the instrument to the wider public. These events often include master classes by visiting recitalists, gala concerts and consecratory services at religious institutions. We have wide experience to offer you in helping to organize these special occasions.</p>

		<p>We guarantee all our work against defects in materials and workmanship for three years, with longer periods and yearly check-ups available. We service almost all Fisk organs close to our Gloucester workshop, and help arrange for regular maintenance by reputable firms for those outside our service radius. Our website and our newsletter offer ways for all members of the extended Fisk family to stay connected, to post concert information and list recordings. You'll receive invitations to future open shops and dedications, and the Fisk Owners Group meetings at AGO conventions. We'll hope to call on you someday to advise future potential clients.</p>

			<p>I want to express my deep appreciation to you and to everyone at C. B. Fisk for your work on Opus 98. The superb instrument which you built for us is something of great value for First Presbyterian Church and the Evansville community. I have heard nothing but positive comments about the organ from the people of the church and the many visitors who have already come to see and hear it. From my standpoint as a musician, the organ is a joy to work with. It has already taught me a great deal. Of course the building of a new organ was the stated purpose of the business association between C. B. Fisk, Inc. and First Presbyterian Church. However, from the time you and Charlie came to Evansville back in 1980, I felt there was something more to the project than just business. Teaching and learning about the ancient but exciting and multi-faceted art was central. And of course there was the determination to do the job as well as it could possibly be done. How appropriate that this art and such attitudes should be nourished and supported by the church!</p>
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>
			<p>There is something that I will treasure as much as the opportunity of working with the new organ: the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the people who built this marvelous instrument with so much care and love for what they are doing. The thoughtful, courteous, generous, and caring attitudes which the people at C. B. Fisk have shown in their relationship with the people of First Presbyterian Church are also things of great value. In this respect, to say nothing of the extraordinary instrument you have built for us, we are beneficiaries of something which is truly priceless.</p>
